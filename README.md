# webpack-startup
WebPack Startup With Basic Configurations

# Running Procedure

This is sample ES6 application, and to make all browsers run this application, we need another tool to convert this to ES5 compatible application. 

This application does **NOTHING** but creates a standard layout for a webpack based application. The steps to run this application includes:

# Install webpack

npm install -g webpack

# Install webpack-dev-server 

npm install -g webpack-dev-server

# Install packages

npm install 

# Start 

npm run start

# Lauch
The running application can be seen by opening the browser with the following address: 

## [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)
